                <p><em>Cubemaku</em> is a Bullet Hell game built for Android and iOS in Unity. </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Cubemaku</em> is programmed in C# using Unity as it's engine. One of it's design elements is an emphasis on flashy effects. 
                    3D Models such as the Player, Enemy, and Bullets are stylized using a custom shader. 
                    Particle Effects emit from dying Enemies, Bullets that have been grazed, or a dying Player.
                    Particle Effects are used heavily when the player casts a special attack.
                </p>
                <p> The player takes control of a green cube, and must progress through many levels dodging enemy red cubes and their bullets. 
                    The longer the player stays alive, the higher score they accumulate. Players also accumulate additional points 
                    and a Special meter by coming extremely close to (or "Grazing") enemy bullets. Players can activate a special ability by double 
                    tapping on the screen. Specials include a traditional Bomb ability, Invincibility, and even a devastating Laser attack. 
                    Enemies will occasionally drop Artifacts, which the player can pick up and use to purchase more Specials and even alternate 
                    themes for menus and color palettes for their Cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Cubemaku</em> was also the subject of a student playtest. Participants were brought in for a half-hour playtest session for an early 
                    version of the game. Their feedback was taken into consideration to find bugs and refine design elements.
